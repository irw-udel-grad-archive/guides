# Python

## Musings of the author
For a while, I resisted learning or using Python. It seemed more wild and free than other languages, and unlike MATLAB or R, I didn't know where Python *lived*. But if you're doing any kind of scientific computing, prototyping, or even just tinkering, especially using open source tools, it's hard to resist for long. So here's something to make the transition easier.

This section contains a few guides on how to get started with Python. It assumes you've heard of Python but haven't really used it. It assumes you want to use Python, maybe even develop some proficiency, but aren't expecting to master it. It assumes you've suffered through an intro MATLAB/engineering/scientific computing course and can figure out what terms like `def` mean and can catch on to syntax well enough to follow along. And above all, it assumes you know how to use Google for anything you want to know more about.
